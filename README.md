# FOC-MOTOR-CONTROLLER
A universal two-phase FOC Motor controller based on STM32.

The original thought is to build a PMSM motor inverter using the knowledge learnt from HPP, but the challenge is PMSMs are way too expensive to get one, plus we won’t have the HV setup to carry out any testing. The idea then shifts to a universal inverter that controls all kinds of motors, e.g. servo motor, step motor, PMSM and BLDC, with voltage rating of 48V and current rating of 20A, that’s maximum power of 960W EACH PHASE.
